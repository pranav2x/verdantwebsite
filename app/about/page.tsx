                  We envision a world where people are more connected to nature, where plant knowledge is democratized,
                  and where technology serves as a bridge between humans and the botanical world around us.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                UseVerdant was founded in 2024 by Ehsan (16) and Pranav (15), two passionate environmental advocates who
                met through their school's environmental club. Their shared love for nature and competitive spirit in
                Envirothon competitions sparked the idea for an AI-powered plant identification app.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Through countless hours spent studying ecosystems and participating in environmental competitions, Ehsan
                and Pranav realized that many people struggle to identify the plants around them. They saw an
                opportunity to bridge this knowledge gap using technology, making botanical expertise accessible to
                everyone.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                What started as a school project has evolved into a comprehensive platform that combines their
                environmental knowledge with cutting-edge AI technology. Their goal is to inspire others to connect with
                nature the same way their environmental club and Envirothon experiences connected them to the natural
                world.
